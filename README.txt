[Doorbell 2.0]
Internet Doorbell with Push Notifications and Message Recording System

simpledoorbell.py is identical to doorbell.py without the addition of Push Notifications
Push Notifications are currently set up to use the PUSHOVER API

You will need to have this file in /home/pi/Scripts 
as well as a 'sounds' folder to contain the mp3 files

The doorbell mp3 I am using can be downloaded by clicking the mp3 icon at
